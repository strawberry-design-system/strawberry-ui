# Strawberry UI

A UI Kit made by devs for devs, with a juicy strawberry touch.

## What is Strawberry UI?

Strawberry UI is a component library designed to make developers' lives easier. With a friendly look and a strawberry-inspired design, it brings a fresh touch to your projects and helps you build faster.

## Why use Strawberry UI?

- **Made for devs** – Built with the developer experience in mind, for quick and intuitive usage.  
- **Ready-to-use design** – Components come with a clean, consistent visual identity so you can focus on building.  
- **Friendly look** – Pleasant interfaces by default, no extra setup needed.  
- **Modular components** – Use only what you need, keep things simple and light.  
- **A little fun** – Because coding is better when it makes you smile.

## Installation

Add Strawberry UI to your project with:

```sh
npm install strawberry-ui
# or
yarn add strawberry-ui
```

## Basic usage

Here's an example of how to use one of the components:

```tsx
import { Button } from "strawberry-ui/react";

export default function App() {
  return <Button variant="outline" tone="neutral">Click me</Button>;
}
```
